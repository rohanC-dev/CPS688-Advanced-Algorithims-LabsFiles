For q2, the algorithim is designed so that the source starts from 0, not 1. 
So, please keep that in mind when you test it. 

For example, if you have a flow network
with 10 nodes, and the source at the 1st node, and the sink at the 10th node, the source
should be entered as 0, and the sink should be entered as 9.
